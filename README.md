# Data-Science-Learning

This repository contains my personal journey and hands-on learning in data science. It includes notes, code, mini-projects, and experiments as I build up my skills in Python, machine learning, statistics, and more.


The purpose of creating this repo is to manage my notes and all the mini projects and assignments do as I move forward in my learning journey. Also to be able to track any changes made to it and being able to easily share these resources with my peers.

# Content
